  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user
    Given user "user2" has logged in using the webUI
    And the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "User One" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with user "User One" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    Then user "User One" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "User One" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for file "testimage.jpg" on the webUI
    And user "user1" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | user2                |
      | share_with  | user1                |
      | file_target | /simple-folder (2)   |
      | item_type   | folder               |
      | permissions | <permissions-folder> |
    And user "user1" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | uid_owner   | user2              |
      | share_with  | user1              |
      | file_target | /testimage (2).jpg |
      | item_type   | file               |
      | permissions | <permissions-file> |
    And as "user1" these resources should be listed on the webUI
      | entry_name        |
      | simple-folder (2) |
      | testimage (2).jpg |
    And these resources should be listed in the folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
      | entry_name |
      | lorem.txt  |
    But these resources should not be listed in the folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
      | entry_name        |
      | simple-folder (2) |
    #    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be marked as shared by "User Two" on the webUI
    #    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be marked as shared by "User Two" on the webUI
    Examples:
      | set-role             | expected-role | permissions-folder        | permissions-file |
      | Viewer               | Viewer        | read                      | read             |

      | Advanced permissions | Viewer        | read                      | read             |

  Scenario Outline: change the collaborators of a file & folder
    Given user "user2" has logged in using the webUI
    And user "user2" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with user "user1" with "<initial-permissions>" permissions
    When the user changes the collaborator role of "User One" for folder "simple-folder" to "<set-role>" using the webUI
    # check role without reloading the collaborators panel, see issue #1786
    Then user "User One" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    # check role after reopening the collaborators panel
    And user "User One" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "user1" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                  |
      | uid_owner   | user2                  |
      | share_with  | user1                  |
      | file_target | /simple-folder (2)     |
      | item_type   | folder                 |
      | permissions | <expected-permissions> |
    Examples:
      | initial-permissions | set-role             | expected-role | expected-permissions      |
      | read,update,create  | Viewer               | Viewer        | read                      |
